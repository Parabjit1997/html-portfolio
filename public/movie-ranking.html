<h2> My Top 3 movies of all time </h2>

<h3> 3 Idiots </h3>
<p> <b> A masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir Khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood. </b>
    <p> Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny and worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood. What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it
        has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down
        the best film in the history of Bollywood. </p>

<h3> 12th Fail</h3>
<p> <b> 12th Fail: Echoes of Resilience </b>
    <p> "12th Fail" is a masterpiece that transcends celluloid, a testament to Vidhu Vinod Chopra's unparalleled storytelling prowess. Through vivid characters, evocative visuals, profound writing, and a soul-stirring soundtrack, he crafts a narrative that
        resonates deeply. Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj Kumar Sharma is a tour de force, embodying a range of emotions that leave an indelible mark. Priyanshu Chatterjee's portrayal of the upright police officer adds a layer of authenticity and
        bravery to the story. The film's exploration of discrimination and resilience is both powerful and poignant, shedding light on the stark choices faced by the marginalized. In every frame, Mr. Vinod Chopra's artistry shines through, turning moments
        into magic.</p>

<h3> Bhaag Milkha Bhaag </h3>
<p> <b> Farhan Akhtar, an epitome of extreme dedication towards the character </b>
    <p> I would certainly be disappointed if this movie doesn't get nominated for the best foreign language film in the academy awards. Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singh's character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography
        was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singh's life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy
        did their job as always. But one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to. Respect for Farhan Akhtar, respect for Milkha Singh, the true hero.</p>
